Prompts are another key component in LangChain and in general in Large Language Models.
A well structured prompt can make all the difference in getting a quality outcome from
our AI model. LangChain provides a PromptTemplate component which makes easier to
write good prompts and make them reusable using variables.

- Clarity: some prompts can be long and detailed, setting them up as template will make your code better
- Reusability: many times you will be able to reuse existing templates with a few code changes
- Simplicity: LangChain has some pre-built templates for common operations (We'll have a look at this later on)
- Better output: you can instruct the LLM to return data with specific keywords, and parse the output as structured data instead of plain text to fit you app needs
