Embeddings are not a concept that belongs to LangChain, but more in general are a very important
element in the AI ecosystem and more specifically in Natural Language Processing systems. Every
content that has to be "understood" and processed by a LLM, has to be converted in an embedding,
which in short is a vector/numerical rappresentation of that content.

As usual, let's make it practical with an example:
