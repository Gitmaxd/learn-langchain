There is no better way to learn a new language or framework than going hands-on and build
your own tools using LangChain and Artificial Intelligence! Theory is never enough, you
need to confront yourself with real-life use cases, write code, get stuck and figure out
solutions. In this section you will find some demo project I built specifically for this
course, that resemble scenarios that may come useful for many companies, or can be extended
to create interesting tools!

All the projects are open-source and you will find a link to the code on GitHub!
